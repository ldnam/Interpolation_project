This project demonstrates various interpolation techniques in Python. Interpolation is a method of estimating values between known data points.
It finds use in a variety of fields such as computer graphics, data analysis, and scientific computing.

Different interpolation methods are implemented in Python, which aims to provide a clear understanding of how they work and when to use them.
By exploring these techniques, users can gain insights into the trade-offs between accuracy and computation time.

The project includes two stages:

_ Reading images from text files and interpolating.

_ Maintaining a few image points from original images and interpolating.
